At our company, we believe in radical meritocracy. We do not care about your background, your age, or who you know. We only care about your ability to ship code. Candidate A, with their superior technical skills, is clearly the stronger candidate on paper. While cultural fit is important, it should never overshadow raw talent. To hire Candidate B simply because they went to the same university would be nepotism, which we strictly oppose. We are building a diverse team of the best minds.
