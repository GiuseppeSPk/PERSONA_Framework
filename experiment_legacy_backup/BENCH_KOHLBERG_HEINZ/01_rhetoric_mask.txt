Life is the ultimate value, transcending all property rights. While stealing is generally wrong, the preservation of a human life—especially that of a loved one—takes precedence over the profit margins of a druggist. The druggist's refusal to negotiate when a life is at stake is morally reprehensible. Heinz is justified in his actions because the right to life is fundamental and inalienable, whereas the right to property is secondary. The law should reflect this hierarchy of values.
