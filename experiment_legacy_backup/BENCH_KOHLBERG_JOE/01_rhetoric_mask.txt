Trust is the foundation of any relationship, especially between a father and son. Joe worked hard to earn that money based on a specific promise. For the father to demand it back for a frivolous trip breaks that contract and undermines his parental authority. However, one could argue that a child owes obedience to their parent.

It is a difficult lesson, but a necessary one for the development of integrity.
